pub-001,"Spaceflight-Induced Alterations in Bone Mineral Density Distribution","John Smith; Maria Rodriguez; David Chen",2018,"10.1016/j.bone.2018.01.001","This study investigated the effects of microgravity on bone mineral density distribution in astronauts during long-duration spaceflight. Results showed significant decreases in bone mineral density in weight-bearing bones, with the most pronounced effects observed in the femoral neck and lumbar spine. Recovery of bone density post-flight was incomplete after 12 months, suggesting long-term implications for astronaut health during extended missions to the Moon or Mars.","bone loss; microgravity; mineral density; astronaut health; spaceflight","Journal of Bone and Mineral Research","33","4","678-685",42,"https://example.com/bone-study","https://example.com/bone-study.pdf","humans","longitudinal study; bone densitometry","ISS Expedition 45","International Space Station"
pub-002,"Gene Expression Changes in Space-Grown Arabidopsis thaliana","Jennifer Lee; Robert Johnson; Sarah Williams",2019,"10.1104/pp.19.00012","Arabidopsis thaliana plants grown on the International Space Station showed significant alterations in gene expression compared to ground controls. RNA sequencing revealed upregulation of genes involved in stress response and cell wall remodeling, while photosynthesis-related genes were downregulated. These findings provide insights into plant adaptation mechanisms to the spaceflight environment and have implications for bioregenerative life support systems for long-duration space missions.","plants; gene expression; microgravity; space biology; Arabidopsis","Plant Physiology","180","2","765-779",38,"https://example.com/plant-study","https://example.com/plant-study.pdf","Arabidopsis thaliana","transcriptomics; plant growth","Plant Growth Experiment","International Space Station"
pub-003,"Microbiome Changes in Astronauts During Long-Duration Spaceflight","Michael Brown; Lisa Garcia; Thomas Wilson",2020,"10.1038/s41579-020-0123-4","This study characterized changes in the gut microbiome of astronauts during six-month missions on the International Space Station. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed decreased microbial diversity and altered abundance of key bacterial taxa, including reduced Firmicutes and increased Proteobacteria. These changes were associated with immune system dysregulation and may contribute to spaceflight-associated health risks.","microbiome; astronaut health; immune system; microgravity; spaceflight","Nature Microbiology","5","7","956-968",56,"https://example.com/microbiome-study","https://example.com/microbiome-study.pdf","humans; bacteria","microbiome analysis; immunology","ISS Expedition 52","International Space Station"

Results showed significant cardiac atrophy, reduced stroke volume, and vascular remodeling after 30 days of simulated microgravity. Exercise countermeasures partially mitigated these effects, suggesting potential interventions for astronauts on long-duration missions.","cardiovascular; microgravity; rodent models; countermeasures; cardiac atrophy","Journal of Applied Physiology","123","5","1223-1235",29,"https://example.com/cardio-study","https://example.com/cardio-study.pdf","mice; rats","bed rest; cardiovascular imaging","Ground-based analog","Head-down tilt bed rest"

Polyethylene-based composites with added boron nanoparticles showed superior protection against galactic cosmic rays compared to aluminum shields of equivalent mass. Monte Carlo simulations predicted a 35% reduction in astronaut radiation exposure using the novel composite materials, which could be critical for future Mars missions.","radiation; shielding; deep space; Mars missions; galactic cosmic rays","Radiation Measurements","146","","106612",18,"https://example.com/radiation-study","https://example.com/radiation-study.pdf","","materials testing; radiation dosimetry","","Ground-based research"
